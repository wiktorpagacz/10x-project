## Project Description
10xCards is a web application that automates the creation of educational flashcards using artificial intelligence. By generating flashcards from user-supplied text (between 1,000 and 10,000 characters), the app reduces the time and effort required for manual flashcard creation. Integrated with a spaced repetition system, 10xCards enhances learning efficiency by allowing users to review, edit, and manage AI-generated flashcards, while also supporting manual creation for custom entries.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend:**
  - Astro 5 – Modern web framework for fast, content-focused websites
  - React 19 – UI library for interactive components
  - TypeScript 5 – Enhances code quality with static typing
  - Tailwind CSS 4 – Utility-first CSS framework for styling
  - Shadcn/ui – Accessible and opinionated React component library

- **Backend:**
  - Supabase – PostgreSQL database and authentication

- **AI Integration:**
  - Openrouter.ai – Connects to various AI models (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, etc.) for flashcard generation

- **CI/CD & Hosting:**
  - GitHub Actions – Continuous integration and delivery
  - DigitalOcean – Hosts the application using Docker

## Getting Started Locally

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/wiktorpagacz/10x-project.git
   cd 10x-project
   ```

2. **Set Node Version:**
   Ensure you are using Node v22.14.0 (as specified in `.nvmrc`):
   ```bash
   nvm use
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. **Run the Development Server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

5. **Build for Production:**
   ```bash

## Project Scope
The MVP of 10xCards includes:
- **Flashcard Generation via AI:** Automatically generating flashcards from text input.
- **User Management:** Registration, login, and password management.
- **Flashcard Review and Curation:** Options to accept, edit, or reject AI-suggested flashcards.
- **Manual Flashcard Creation:** Ability to add flashcards manually.
- **Flashcard Collection Management:** View, edit, delete, and search saved flashcards.
- **Spaced Repetition Integration:** Scheduling accepted flashcards for review based on an optimized algorithm.
- **Event Logging:** Tracking key system events for performance analysis.
- **Basic Security Measures:** Implementation of authentication, authorization, and input validation.

## Project Status
The project is currently in the MVP stage with core functionalities implemented. Future improvements will focus on enhanced flashcard types, more robust user interactions, and additional educational integrations.
